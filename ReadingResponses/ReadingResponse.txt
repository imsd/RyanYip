The founder is a game that involves the creation of a company and it's development into a corporation. Your goal in the game is to accumulate more money than you know what to do with. In all honesty I spent most of the game waiting as my company accumulated money. I went through a number of failures and restarts and eventually gave up on the game. It was almost like a mobile game that made for a good time killer on a train ride. In was pleasant and enjoyable but the game wasn't for me.
