# Internet of things Proposal

A unity program that would draw names from two different websites and place them in a unity environment. The names would be of all 800+ pokemon by name. The program would search for one of the 800+ names from two different websites and place them in the unity environment. The user would then be able to select a moveset from a list of available moves and battle a computer controlled opponent. The move list would consist of moves that are available to the pokemon in the base games. The user would select from this list while a computer selects from it's own.
