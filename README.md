# Project 2(Projection Mapping Project)

## Ryan Yip, Ryan Charles, Rashid, Catherine and Mike 

Project was a projection mapping of a unity environment. The environment had three cameras positioned to view a section of the environment. The environment mainly consisted of three sections colored in blue, green and yellow. A key would be pressed to launch a red ball into the air. These balls would pass through each environment and be placed into a box in one of the environments. This box would overflow and spill into the other environments.
